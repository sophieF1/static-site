            <p class="lead">The Dublin Tech Summit was held at the impressive Convention Centre on
            Dublin’s dockside across two days.
            DTS was themed around predicted technology trends for the year ahead such as IoT, Medtech and Big Data.
            The positives that not only other conferences but us as technologists can take away from DTS is
            what I will focus on here; the
            impact for attendees and why attending such well organised and varied themed conferences should be a
            priority for all those working in technology.</p>

            <p>There are many other conferences that receive highly positive reviews and are
            well recommended, however I am bias here in this being my first such conference whereby there wasn’t
            a specific focus on one stream of technology (I have attended others, but with a specific area of
            technology focus)
            Like many of us in the world of tech, I like to keep engaged with the community and to see what areas are going
            to make
            an impact in the present and upcoming years. In particular I'm currently interested in Medtech as this is an
            area which
            has so much potential for technology to make a significant impact, so attending DTS I was looking forward to
            hearing
            from key speakers currently associated in the field. </br> </br>

            I found DTS to be not only extremely well organised and showcasing excellent speakers but
            the fact that 48% of attendees were women was a great indicator of DTS's commitment to pushing for a
            diverse conference. So how was this achieved?
            DTS ran a campaign that gave €400,000 worth of tickets away to under-represented groups in
            the tech industry, including women and students. The campaign clearly worked as walking around the
            convention center over the two days, there was a clear mix of both female and male attendees.</br>
            I have attended conferences previously where I can count on one hand the number of women attendees,
            therefore with the initiatives DTS used working, highlighted positive progression towards achieving
            more diversity at such events, which other conferences can learn from.</br>
            Diversity is spoken about a lot within technology and it needs to be. A diverse,
            well organised and engaging conference are all factors that are key for successful teams, companies and people
            and there is clear evidence supporting this, which is where DTS scored highly on promoting a diverse
            environment. </br> </br>

            The first talk I saw was my overall favourite, given by Matthew Luhn on the 'Art of Storytelling'
            </p> </br>

            This is can be seen metaphorically in software development and with the relationships you build
            working with clients and your team. As software engineers we want to not only build and design great solutions,
            but should always be keeping in mind forming strong working relationships too.
            We spend a good proportion of our time on a machine writing code, but to come to that point we have
            to first interact with each other and produce great design. Plus the interaction shouldn't just end once an
            architectural design has been put together. If adopting an agile work environment change
            will continuously happen and this shouldn't be a feared. Therefore if you're working in a truly agile way, interaction will be
            in every step of the development cycle and ensuring you have a open healthy environment for this, is crucial to a
            successful end product.
            Enthused and motivated teams produce success. </br>
            </br>
            Working in technology we are fully aware of the fast-changing nature of the
            industry and the importance of keeping up to date with the latest developments. I got to experience a range of talks in different fields,
            learnt new things and networked with others. This is important
            not only for self-development but will contribute value to your company with the work that you do. Projects will always vary in their required
            technology stack and it is unlikely you will be using the same language, framework or tool for each
            project you are involved in. Therefore it is even more relevant to all developers that
            we go and encourage others to attend diverse conferences. </br>
            </br>

            I came away at the end of the two days feeling not only inspired but with
            new applicable transferable knowledge that will be used in the work place. This was the outcome I was
            hoping for and DTS exceeded all initial expectations.
            I encourage anyone working in technology to go and see DTS for themselves in the future. </p>
